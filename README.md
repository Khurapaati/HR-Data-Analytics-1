## Project Insights
* High Attrition Rate: The attrition rate is 16.1%, which is significantly higher than the national average of around 3.6%. This suggests that the company is losing employees at an alarming rate.
* Gender Disparity: There is a significant gender disparity in the attrition rate, with 237 men leaving the company compared to 147 women. This suggests that men are more likely to leave the company than women.
* Age-Related Attrition: The average age of employees who leave the company is 37, which is younger than the average age of the workforce as a whole. This suggests that the company is losing younger employees.
* Departmental Differences: There is a significant difference in the attrition rate between departments. The R&D department has the highest attrition rate (33.49%), followed by Sales (27.6%) and HR (25%). This suggests that employees in these departments are more likely to leave the company than employees in other departments.
* Job Role Matters: The attrition rate also varies by job role. Sales Representatives have the highest attrition rate (42%), followed by Research Scientists (33%) and Research Directors (21%). This suggests that employees in these roles are more likely to leave the company than employees in other roles.
Performance and Attrition: There is a weak correlation between performance rating and attrition rate. This suggests that performance is not a major factor in employee attrition.
